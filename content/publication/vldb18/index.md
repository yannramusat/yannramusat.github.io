abstract: 'This demonstration showcases ProvSQL, an open-source module for the PostgreSQL database management system that adds support for computation of provenance and probabilities of query results. A large range of provenance formalisms are supported, including all those captured by provenance semirings, provenance semirings with monus, as well as where-provenance. Probabilistic query evaluation is made possible through the use of knowledge compilation tools, in addition to standard approaches such as enumeration of possible worlds and Monte-Carlo sampling. ProvSQL supports a large subset of non-aggregate SQL queries.'
